## Bot detection and social contagion  
Below you'll find several sections containing research related to social botnet creation and detection, as well as some reading about social contagion in online social networks. The approaches to social botnet detection are as varied as the methods for creating them. They vary in complexity, objectives and command-and-control capabilities. It's important to consider that often, if not always, when researching social botnets (especially on Twitter) you're likely to encounter several independent botnet communities that may not share design, objectives or organizational characteristics. Sophisticated social botnets may span platforms, utilize digital personas with a high degree of "digital pedigree" and often have tiers of personas (i.e. bots that only retweet based on topics, some that are semi-automated but with human intervention in certain cases, etc.).
