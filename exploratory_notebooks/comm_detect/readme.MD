## Some notebooks for community detection.
- pre_process.ipynb: julia pre-processing of the json files. builds the graph.
- parse_py.ipynb: python/gensim parsing of the json files from @wwymak
- comm_detect_nmf.ipynb: julia. runs a regularized community detection algorithm based on both graph structure and word content
- method_compare: julia. runs alternate methods for community detection. for now only Louvain.
