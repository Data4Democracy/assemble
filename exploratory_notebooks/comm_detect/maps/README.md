# Maptiling scatterplot.
Refactored! See the notebook for example utilisation.
Basically, this takes any set of scatter points, with associated sizes, labels,
and coordinates, and creates a set of tiles to vizualize it with leaflet.
In this version the quadtree creation and plotting are separate so should be
easier to create better backends (typically using geojson...)
Let me know if any questions - @henripal
