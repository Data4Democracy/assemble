Sheeba’s limp had gotten worse, and she was dragging her back legs. The boys investigated and found a dead black snake in the kitchen with bite marks from a dog. The apprentice was driving and Simon was carrying our 50kg dog in back. He drove it to Beenleigh, put his own credit card down and got the dog treated. Even had the presence of mind to call ahead to find out which vet had anti – venom. As it turns out the snake was a whip snake, poisonous, but usually not fatal : it causes paralysis. Still, very few tradesman would put themselves out the way he did. He didn’t even put the ad hoc ambulance trip on his invoice. We arrived at the vet not long after him. Thanks Simon.

But he was also a middle-aged white man with a Southern accent who seemed unperturbed by this week’s news.”\\n>This created fear: “While I had him in the apartment, I couldn’t stop thinking about whether he had voted for Trump, whether he knew my last name is Jewish, and how that knowledge might change the interaction we were having inside my own home.”\\n>When it was all over, Resnikoff reported that he was “rattled” at the thought that a Trump supporter might have been in his home. “I couldn’t shake the sense of potential danger.”\\nfucking kek',\n",
