# How-to guide to upload dataset to s3

If you have data you would like to share with the group. Submit a PR with a new `readme.md` in the `data` directory. General recommended structure is outlined below.

**note** if this is a fully curated/structured dataset [data.world](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/read-this-first/blob/master/data-world.md) may be a better home. S3 is for raw or work in progress data.
