## Assemble

**Slack:** #assemble

**Project Description:** Assemble is a [data for democracy](https://github.com/Data4Democracy) community working to build tools and infrastructure to enable the study of online communities and their characteristics. As we work through our own projects, our goal is to build a toolkit which takes care of common tasks so researchers do not have to reinvent the wheel with each new project.  

**Project Leads:**
* @bstarling
* @nick

**Maintainers:**
* @sjackson
* @wwymak
* @mattgawarecki

## Getting Started:
* Checkout individual project repositories listed [below](#infrastructure). Issues tagged `beginner-friendly` are good candidates for your first PR. Core maintainers and project leads are responsible for reviewing and merging all pull requests. In order make your first PR a positive experience we recommend reply on github or post in #assemble if you're interested in tackling your first issue. From there a maintainer or project lead will help you through the process.
* Need to practice working with github in a group setting? Checkout [github-playground](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/github-playground)
* Updates to documentation or readme are greatly appreciated and make for a great first PR. They do not need to be discussed in advance and will be merged as soon as possible.
* Any problems, issues or questions along the way? DM @bstarling in Slack.  


### Infrastructure
If you like the idea of building tools that will help enable analysis across many domains these projects are a great place to start. If you have an idea for a dataset you would like to collect please file a proposal via GitHub issue with the label `proposal`.  

### Curation
Leveraging the Infrastructure group's fantastic work, the Curation team makes available repositories of information about online communities. The data is "analysis ready" and has been curated to support downstream analytical objectives, and the team works closely with the data.world staff.  

### Infrastructure Projects
* [Discursive](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/discursive): Framework for searching or streaming tweets storing them in Elasticsearch and S3.
* [Collect-Social](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/collect-social): This project aims to make that collection process as simple as possible, by making some common-sense assumptions about what most researchers need, and how they like to work with their data. For example, tasks like grabbing all the posts and comments from a handful of Facebook pages, and dumping the results into a sqlite database.
* [Reddit-Api-Miner](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/reddit-api-miner)  

### Curation Projects

### Tutorials and Example Notebooks:
We need people who would like to write [tutorials](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/assemble/tree/master/tutorials) or script examples on how to do common tasks.  
* Do not worry if you are not an expert. Tutorials from the perspective of a beginner are great for other beginners.
