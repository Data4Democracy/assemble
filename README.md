## Who are we?  
**Assemble** is a [data for democracy](https://github.com/Data4Democracy) community working to build tools and infrastructure to enable the study of online communities and their characteristics. As we work through our own projects, our goal is to build a toolkit which takes care of common tasks so researchers do not have to reinvent the wheel with each new project.  

### Infrastructure
If you like the idea of building tools that will help enable analysis across many domains these projects are a great place to start. If you have an idea for a dataset you would like to collect please file a proposal via GitHub issue with the label `proposal`.  

### Curation
Leveraging the Infrastructure group's fantastic work, the Curation team makes available repositories of information about online communities. The data is "analysis ready" and has been curated to support downstream analytical objectives, and the team works closely with the data.world staff. 

## Getting started:  
* Introduce yourself in the [#assemble](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/assemble/) Slack channel!  
* Checkout individual project repositories listed below. Issues tagged `beginner-friendly` are good candidates for your first PR. Express your interest in Slack or comment on an issue you are interested in working on.  
* Notice an typo or have an improvement to our README? Submit a PR!  
* Need to practice before you submit your first PR? See our   [github-playground](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/github-playground)  
* Any problems, issues or questions along the way? DM @bstarling in Slack.  

### Infrastructure Projects
* [Discursive](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/discursive): Framework for searching or streaming tweets storing them in Elasticsearch and S3.
* [Collect-Social](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/collect-social): This project aims to make that collection process as simple as possible, by making some common-sense assumptions about what most researchers need, and how they like to work with their data. For example, tasks like grabbing all the posts and comments from a handful of Facebook pages, and dumping the results into a sqlite database.
* [Reddit-Api-Miner](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/reddit-api-miner)  

### Curation Projects
* Check back soon for project repositories

### Tutorials and Example Notebooks:
We need people who would like to write tutorials or script examples on how to do common tasks.  
* Do not worry if you are not an expert. Tutorials from the perspective of a beginner are great for other beginners.  
* If interested contact @bstarling in Slack.
