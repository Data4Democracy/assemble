### Getting Started

Eventador.io is a real time data processing platform that is available to the project free of charge. To use it do the following:

- Sign up for Eventador.io [here](https://console.eventador.io/register)
- In the #assemble Slack channel, ping @kgorman or @erikbeebe to add you to the D4D account OR
- Email Eventador [Support](mailto:support@eventador.io) and request access.

## Using Eventador.io

In order to partition work out for a variety of use cases, project contributors should use unique topic's for discrete workloads. This will allow everyone to utilize the system and not have data collisions or a general data mess.

To create a topic:

- Login to Eventador.io [here](http://www.eventador.io/login)
- Click on the Deployment you would like to use (initially there is one called 'assemble').
- Select the 'add Topic' button.
- Name your Topic something descriptive.
- Use this Topic when publishing data to Eventador.io

**NOTE** you will need to open an ACL to your client interface in order to connect. Eventador is closed by default, and must have an IP whitelist created for your IP or IP range in order to use it.

To create an ACL:
